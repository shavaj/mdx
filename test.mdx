# Static IP for using eGauge meters with Teltonika's RUT devices

Teltonika RUT based devices by default will assign IP addresses to devices connected on the lan port in range between **100-150**. This is also known as the DHCP range.

In order to ensure IP of the devices that we pair using MOS350 does not change over time, we need to assign a static IP to the device.


```jsx:"Sample"
export async function generateStaticParams() {
    const posts = await getPostsMeta() //deduped!

    if (!posts) return []

    return posts.map((post) => ({
        postId: post.id
    }))
}
```


## eGauge network settings

- To do this, uncheck the option **Automatically obtain address with DHCP** as shown below
- Assign an IP address that is out of the DHCP range, for example 192.168.1.88 in this case.
- If you have more than one meter, choose the IP 192.168.1.89 for the second one.
- Care should be taken to ensure you don't assign the same IP to more than one device.
